# Font Setup

Place the BBH Bartle font file here as `BBHBartle.woff2`

If you don't have the .woff2 format, you can convert your font file using online tools like:
- https://cloudconvert.com/ttf-to-woff2
- https://transfonter.org/

The font is already configured in the layout and DecryptedText component.
